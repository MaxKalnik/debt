Major data security incidents, such as the Equifax security breach, have been widely reported on. Events such as these take place on a smaller scale almost daily, and as such, the integral role of the internet in today’s society exposes all of us to risk, especially when it comes to our bank accounts, credit cards, and our credit histories. Financial fraud is a risk not only to our present financial and personal security, but it can affect us for years to come.</p><p class="under-title under-title--last">RewardExpert drilled into the data to determine in which states your risk of becoming a victim of identity theft, credit card fraud, and related crimes is highest, and in which states you are at relatively less risk. We took into account the incidence rates of reported credit card fraud and identity theft, as well as year-over-year trends and the severity of the financial losses incurred by each event. We also took into account reports of internet-mediated incidents of fraud and identity theft, which we obtained from the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (henceforth referred to as IC3).</p></section><section class="section section--k-findings"><h2 class="section__title section__title--white">Key Findings</h2><div class="k-findings"><div class="k-findings__img-wrapper"><picture><source src="images/photo/robber.png" srcset="images/photo/robber@2x.png 2x"><img src="images/photo/robber.png" srcset="images/photo/robber@2x.png 2x" class="k-findings__img"></picture></div><ul class="k-findings__list"><li class="k-findings__list-item"><p class="k-findings__list-item-text">From 2015 to 2016 reports of credit card fraud increased nationwide by 5.15%</p></li><li class="k-findings__list-item"><p class="k-findings__list-item-text">Reports of identity theft decreased significantly, by 16.05% in the same time period.</p></li><li class="k-findings__list-item"><p class="k-findings__list-item-text">Across the states, we observed absolutely no correlation between per capita income and incidents of identity theft and/or credit card fraud.
