  | Dealing with debt collectors is almost never a pleasant experience. Even though they are exempt from regulation under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977, first-party creditors have an incentive to maintain a constructive relationship with their customers, even those with outstanding past-due debts, and are thus less likely to engage in illegal or abusive collection practices. This is not the case with third-party debt collectors, who purchase and profit on the right to collect debts that have been charged-off and written off as a loss by the original creditor. In recent years the debt buying industry has expanded dramatically, and attempts to collect “zombie debts,” &#8212; attempts to collect debts not owed, debts that were already paid or discharged, debts owed by someone else, or due to identity theft &#8212; have reached epidemic scale.
