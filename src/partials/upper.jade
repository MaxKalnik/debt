  | The threat of theft has never been greater, be it of your personal identity information, financial assets and account details, or of vast quantities of such data all at once. Major data security incidents, such as the Equifax security breach, have been widely reported on. Events such as these take place on a smaller scale almost daily, and as such, the integral role of the internet in today’s society exposes all of us to risk, especially when it comes to our bank accounts, credit cards, and our credit histories. Financial fraud is a risk not only to our present financial and personal security, but it can affect us for years to come.

  | RewardExpert drilled into the data to determine in which states your risk of becoming a victim of identity theft, credit card fraud, and related crimes is highest, and in which states you are at relatively less risk. We took into account the incidence rates of reported credit card fraud and identity theft, as well as year-over-year trends and the severity of the financial losses incurred by each event. We also took into account reports of internet-mediated incidents of fraud and identity theft, which we obtained from the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (henceforth referred to as IC3).
