    | Financial services are subject to government regulation, and are affected by policy dictated by elected politicians. Naturally, financial institutions have political preferences, but do these preferences affect you, the consumer? Are the banks playing politics with you and your money? Here at RewardExpert, we wanted to find out, and we soon discovered a pattern that suggests the answer is yes.

    | RewardExpert looked at the consumer complaints data set from the CFPB, which includes complaints lodged against financial institutions about credit cards, bank accounts, and mortgages, and used GIS software to analyse the geographical distribution of complaints throughout the country. We wanted to see where people have more problems with financial institutions on average, and we observed that high complaint rates were concentrated in diverse, urban regions that typically vote for democratic candidates.

    | We then visualized per capita rates of complaints about credit cards, bank accounts, and mortgages filed with the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau on a map of the United States. We noticed that this map looked strikingly similar to maps of county-by-county results of the last few presidential elections.
