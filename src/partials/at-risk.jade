      | On all measures, Nevada takes first place as the state in which the risk of credit card fraud and identity theft is highest. Nevada is one of only six states in which reports of identity theft increased from 2015 to 2016 according to the FTC Consumer Sentinel Report. The only positive development to report in this state is that on a per-incident basis, the financial losses incurred by fraud are slightly lower than the national average.

      | California (with Florida and Michigan) leads the nation in reports of identity theft, per the FTC Consumer Sentinel Report. Incidents in California tend to involve larger losses than the national average. The average credit card fraud incident in California incurs a $3,667 bill, and identity theft cases average $7,543.  The national average losses are $2,678 for identity theft, and $2,935 for credit card fraud. California’s higher loss figures exceed the national averages to a greater degree than the state’s average income exceeds the national average income.

      | Continuing the geographical pattern, New Mexico is our third place “winner.” According to the FTC, credit card fraud complaints have increased by a whopping 12.73% in the course of a year. According to the FBI, the average incident costs a resident of New Mexico $3,647, which is almost the same amount as in California, and New Mexicans are on average less financially well-equipped to absorb such a loss, with an average per capita income of $45,382 to California’s $64,500.

      | Coming in at fourth, Florida should surprise no one: Florida has the dubious distinction of having the highest per capita rate of credit card fraud incidents as of 2016 (1,305 per 100,000 residents). This represents a significant improvement over the previous year, with a decline of 13.54% in reported credit card fraud.

      | Texans have been experiencing significant trouble with fraud and identity theft, with Texas coming in at fourth for complaints filed with the CFPB, fifth for reports of fraud according to the Consumer Sentinel report, and third for internet-mediated credit card fraud. Texas also takes third place in terms of the average financial losses due to fraud, with a staggeringly high price tag of $7,275 per incident. This figure may be a consequence of Texas’ relatively loose regulatory apparatus, or due to other less political causes.

      | Michigan is part of a second hot-spot for fraudulent credit card activity and stolen identities. According to the most recent FTC data, Michigan has the highest rate of identity theft in the nation, affecting 175 out of every 100,000 residents, at an average cost of $2,762 per incident, according to data from the FBI. Additionally, Michigan is one of six states that saw an increase in identity theft; a 17% increase from 2015 to 2016. Credit card fraud is marginally less common and severe, however the state still ranks third overall for fraud.

      | At first glance, Virginia is a geographical outlier. However, when all of the data is taken into account, its presence in our top ten makes more sense: credit card fraud and identity theft correlate with increasing population and/or the presence or proximity of a major metropolitan area, in this case, Washington, DC. There was an 8% increase in reports of fraud in the last year in Virginia, while financial losses per capita are in the 80th percentile.

      | Arizona is the fifth state in the Southwestern region to make our list. This is likely due to its fast growing, diverse population, as well as an relatively high number of older residents and others particularly vulnerable to fraud and theft. Arizona’s rate of identity theft is high, in the 81st percentile according to data from the FTC, and 84th according to internet crime data from the FBI.

      | Like its neighbor Michigan, Illinois has a serious identity theft problem. Illinois ranks third in the nation for identity theft, which affects 138 in 100,000 residents. Reported losses due to theft are also very high, with an average cost of $4,700 per incident. This is mitigated, however, by a significantly lower rate of credit card fraud than identity theft, at 576 per 100,000 residents, a rate that is much lower than Michigan’s 701 per 100,000 rate.

      | As a state with a rapidly growing population and a technology industry that is a significant engine of the state’s economy, it is not surprising that the state of Washington has one of the highest rates of credit card fraud perpetrated using the internet (8 per 100,000 residents,  with an overall incidence of 555 per 100,000). Fraud reports are on the rise here, increasing 9.68% from 2015 to 2016.
