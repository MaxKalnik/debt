        | Delaware leads the nation when it comes to the likelihood of having to deal with a collection agency trying to collect a debt you don’t owe. With a total of 422 complaints in the Consumer Complaint Database, Delaware has a per-capita rate of 44.72 complaints per 100,000 residents. Although it ranks tenth nationally, Encore Capital Group leads second-place ERC in terms of the number of complaints per capita, 25.4 per million to 16.9 million.

        | Hard-hit by the mortgage crisis and the collapse of the housing bubble, Florida is naturally one of the “usual suspects,” and indeed, it comes in at number two with 42.43 complaints per 100,000 residents (a total of 8,314 complaints in all). As with other states, and in accordance with the national pattern, we see significantly higher per-capita rates of reports of attempts to collect out-of-statute, paid, or unverifiable debts, in the younger and more diverse large metro areas, such as Miami, Jacksonville, and Tampa, where we see rates upward of 56 per 100,000. Both top offender Encore Capital, and second-place Portfolio Recovery Associates have been sued and sanctioned by federal and state regulators for improper collection practices, and have settled these suits for millions of dollars in damages.

        | Third-place Georgia trails Florida by two hundredths in its per capita incidence rate of reports of zombie debt collection attempts, with 4,258 complaints registered and a population of almost exactly 10 million residents. The geographical disparity in Georgia is even more pronounced than in Florida (which is relatively hard-hit statewide), with 75 complaints per 100,000 in the core urban area of Atlanta, 60 per 100,000 in the metropolitan area, while the complaint rate falls to as low as 11 per 100,000 in adjacent rural regions.

        | Like Florida, all areas of Nevada (with the exception of Carson City) have incidence rates of illegal debt collection attempts well above the national average of 25.84 per 100,000. The cities of Las Vegas and Reno and their environs face significantly elevated rates - and since the population of Nevada is highly concentrated in these two areas, their incidence rates of 42 and 46 per 100,000 elevate the state’s already high rate of illegal debt collection complaints.

        | Number five, Maryland, closely trails Nevada, with 38.65 complaints per 100,000 residents. Like most of the states in our top ten, the companies responsible for the most reported illegal attempts to collect debts that are no longer valid, or never were valid, are the same as those atop the national “hall of shame” list, Encore Capital Group and ERC. Here, we can infer on empirical grounds an element of racial bias independent of confounding economic factors, such as income and residence in an urban area. The affluent, suburban, and majority-black Prince George’s County has an incidence rate of 66.6 per 100,000 residents, while neighboring Montgomery County’s incidence rate is a much lower 39.1 per 100,000.

        | In Texas, once again we see a pattern similar to that which we have already observed: cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas report an elevated rate of illegal collection attempts. Even in cities such as Amarillo, Lubbock, Abilene, and El Paso, which have complaint rates lower than the national average (between 10.4 for Amarillo, to 19.9 in Abilene) are significantly higher than in the areas around them (with rates as low as 3.4 per 100,000).

        | Interestingly, in New Jersey the pattern we have noted in the geographical distribution of complaint rates partially breaks down: the cities of Camden, Trenton, and Atlantic City experience fewer illegal collection attempts than the national average (23 per 100,000 vs 25.8). This is perhaps due to stronger-than-average state regulation and enforcement activity (New Jersey is one of many states with its own Fair Debt Collection Practices Act). The runner-up for the company with the most complaints per capita,

        | Coming in at number eight, California barely falls short of New Jersey in terms of illegal collection attempts per capita. Again, we see hot spots in and around the major cities in California, such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, although the disparity is less marked than elsewhere, while the city of San Diego barely edges out the national average (26.05 per 100,000 to 25.8). The affluent Bay Area likewise displays lower rates than would be expected in such a densely populated region.

        | Rounding out our list, at number ten, is Virginia. Here we can see clearly the reason why the geographical distribution of the zombie debt epidemic diverges from a simple urban-rural divide: the affluent suburban and exurban regions of Northern Virginia have incidence rates that rival or exceed those of major cities statewide, which reflects the tactics of entities attempting to collect on such debts, namely, targeting affluent individuals whose finances have improved. In support of this argument, we have the higher-than-average incidence rates of wealthy Fairfax and Prince William Counties (ranging from 33 to 56 per 100,000 residents).
