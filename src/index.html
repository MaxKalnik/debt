						The recent release of the annual Crime in the United States (CIUS) statistics report by the FBI has once again brought the issue of public safety into the media spotlight. Breathless headlines would have you believe that what we are seeing is the beginning of a national crime wave, and while on the national level there has been an increase in homicide and other violent crime, the data in fact paints a more complicated picture. Nationally, the rate of property crime has fallen. Dig a little deeper, and you’ll find that most cities, even the largest, have become safer. Which places – large and small, from coast to coast – are in reality the safest, and which are most dangerous?
					</p>

					<p class="main-text">
						While preparing our list of the country’s safest places, it became clear that it isn’t enough to rate cities and towns by crime statistics alone. Becoming a victim of a violent or non-violent crime is only one important part of what we mean when we say “this is a safe place to live.”  Our list, therefore, relies on a more robust and expansive definition of safety than what crime statistics alone can tell us.
					</p>
					<p class="main-text">
						RewardExpert crunched the numbers to give you the most comprehensive perspective on safety we could. To rank of the safest and most dangerous cities in the country, we not only analyzed FBI crime statistics; we contextualized them as well, keeping in mind the fact that there is much more to safety than crime and murder rates. After all, you are less likely to become a homicide victim than you are to die in a car crash, and likewise, disaster and disease are greater threats to your safety and security than property crime. And finally, while broken bones beat broken windows, safety includes not only life and limb, but livelihood as well.

					</p>
					<p class="main-text">
						Taking the FBI crime statistics as our starting point, we used 32 indicators from data sets produced by both the public and private-sector, to compare cities and towns with populations greater than 3,000 people, across 8 major categories: 1) Crime, 2) Mortality Rates, 3) Firearms, 4) Motor vehicle crash risks, 5) Man-made environmental hazards, 6) Natural disasters, 7) Economic and financial risks, and finally, 8) Health risks and health care.

Irvine is distinguished by its extraordinarily low homicide rate, which is below the national average at 1.12 homicides per 100,000 people. Irvine also rates highly on measures of safety such as damage due to natural disasters (5.65th percentile) and premature mortality (4.7 per 100,000). Residents of the city (which is home to numerous universities and tech-industry companies) are, on the whole, financially secure and enjoy healthcare access well above the national average.</p>

                <p class="cities-items__text">New York City has come a long way in terms of safety in recent decades. Once one of the most dangerous and crime infested cities, New York City now boasts a murder rate well below the national average, standing at 3.9 per 100,000 (335 in a population of 8,566,917). With some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation, New York has less firearm related fatalities than almost 99% of the country. While New Yorkers are not known for having the healthiest lifestyles, this is mitigated by the city having some of the best healthcare facilities in the nation, as well as a high concentration of medical professionals.  And while car crash-related injuries and fatalities are high here, they are less likely to involve city residents, who are well-served by public transportation.</p>

The safety of Chula Vista is enhanced by its low risk of natural disaster damage, and by its clean environment. Its residents, moreover, have a very low rate of housing and financial insecurity, with some of the lowest rates of foreclosure or mortgage delinquency.</p>

This is because of the exceptional degree of financial security its residents enjoy, and it's extraordinarily low levels of unemployment and income inequality (3.4% and 3.6%, in the 7.4th and 2.8th percentile nationwide.) Austin is also very unlikely to be damaged by natural disasters, so its nearly one million inhabitants are safer than crime statistics alone would seem to indicate.</p>

The weighted average of Omaha’s crime rate is below the median for mid-size and larger cities, and middle of the pack nation-wide risks for environmental, health, and premature mortality rates. Omaha is extraordinarily safe from an economic or financial perspective, with less than one third of the median percentile ranking of cities in its size category on this dimension, having very little income inequality. This is not to mention the fact that Omaha has a very low liability to damage by natural disasters.</p>

								<p class="cities-items__text">First on our list of the most dangerous midsize and larger cities is Tulsa, Oklahoma. One of several cities, both large and small, in Oklahoma that are among the most dangerous in the country, Tulsa ranks first on three metrics: 1) it has the highest rate of firearm-related fatalities (total of 114 deaths in 2016; or 21 per 100,000); 2) it has the highest rate of fatal automobile crashes reported both on the local level through the DOT FARS system during 2015 (42 fatalities in 41 accidents), and on the county level (with which the city is coextensive) according to the CDC report (50 fatalities; or 23 per 100,000); and 3) it has the highest overall rate of premature deaths per capita. Coupled with homicide and violent crime rates well above the national average, and the average for cities in its size bracket, Tulsa easily edges out St. Louis, Missouri.</p>

St. Louis also takes first place for the number of EPA-designated contaminated sites and toxic chemical releases, both absolutely and relative to the city’s greatly diminished population.  St. Louis is only slightly safer according to other measures, with a lower rate of losses due to natural disaster, and lower foreclosure and fatal drug overdose rates than most of the other cities on this list.</p>

Finally, Cincinnati has the dubious distinction of having the highest rate of arson in the country (162.272 per 100,000 people).</p>

Cleveland has the second highest rate of violent crime, and of homicide (16.3 per 1,000, and 34.9 per 100,000 respectively), and the most rapes per capita. Cleveland is also home to the second-highest number of contaminated sites, including 37 Superfund sites and 219 toxic chemical releases. Arson and overdose rates are also among the highest in the nation, and just about the only thing Cleveland has to offer as far as safety is concerned is its low risk of damage due to natural disaster.</p>

This decline, though, has led Buffalo to have the second highest rate of foreclosures, leaving the city with more vacant housing than it can handle. With a violent crime rate of 11.09 per 1,000, and a murder rate of 17.091 per 100,000 in 2016, Buffalo is not safe by any measure – as a whole.</p>

                <p class="cities-items__text">The list of the top ten most dangerous midsize and big cities ends very close to where it began, with Oklahoma City at number ten. Like Tulsa, Oklahoma City has an extraordinarily high number and rate of fatalities due to automobile accidents, with 86 deaths recorded here in 2015 by the Fatal Crash Reporting System, and a 15 per 100,000 vehicle-related mortality rate in the 2017 CDC report. Oklahoma City does not differ when it comes to the high level of firearm-related fatalities, and overall high rate of violent crime. Healthcare access is relatively poor, although overdose fatalities are surprisingly low. Low unemployment, high median income, and low income inequality mitigate Oklahoma City’s high rate of foreclosure, but this does not do enough to boost safety to bump Oklahoma City off of our list.</p>

There were no violent crimes committed in Rock Valley during 2016, and non-violent crime here was limited to theft and a handful of burglaries. According to the EPA, the environment here is relatively free of pollution. Remarkably, the inhabitants of Rock Valley have short and safe commutes.</p>

								<p class="cities-items__text">The number one most dangerous small city in America is clearly Pine Bluff, Arkansas, home to 43,976 people. Only 1.42% of all places for which the FBI published crime statistics had a higher incidence of both violent and nonviolent crimes (including 9 homicides, 38 rapes, and 62 acts of arson), while according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control in March of 2017, the rate of premature deaths (defined as death at an age of less than 70 years old) is in the 97th percentile. Pine Bluff also contains a high number of EPA-designated polluted sites and toxic chemical releases, while residents are at only slightly less risk due to unhealthy behaviors, disease, and flooding.</p>

                <p class="cities-items__text">Located in the Birmingham, Alabama region, the town of Lincoln is afflicted by exceptionally high rates of crime and premature death. A historically industrial town with an economy based in manufacturing, environmental conditions are about what one would expect, while OSHA reports at least 16 workplace accidents involving loss of life or limb in the last 15 years. Despite an unusually low rate of gun crime and car accidents for the region, Lincoln takes number two on our list of most dangerous small cities on the basis of its relatively high level of health hazards and risk factors, and its exceptionally low level of access to healthcare (3.1 percentile)</p>

Bastrop takes the cake for lives cut short for any reason, ranking in the 99th percentile for mortality rate, with a motor vehicle fatality rate of 28 in 100,000, of which 35% involved an alcohol-impaired driver. In terms of its crime rate, Bastrop is hardly any better, while healthcare and highway safety here are dismal. The fact that all of this is likely to be a legacy of socioeconomic and racial divides does not change the fact that times are hard in the city of Bastrop.</p>

Much of the city was damaged in 1999 by an outbreak of tornadoes, which injured 134 people, with another tornado striking here less than five years later. Crime and health risks are likewise quite high, as are gun violence and premature mortality rates. These risks are partially mitigated by somewhat greater economic and financial security.</p>

This, however, is the lesser of many evils that earn it fifth place on our list of the most dangerous small cities in the nation. Like Bastrop, Louisiana, and others to follow, this is in part a consequence of the socio-economic heritage of segregation and racialized politics in the southern US. The FBI Crime in the United States statistics for 2016 show a high rate of both violent and property crimes, which is weighted even higher in our analysis due to high incidence rates of homicide (4.1 per 10,000) and arson.</p>

Manufacturing and mining continue in and around the city, and pose ongoing health and occupational hazards to residents. Today, the city is home to five EPA Superfund sites, and the EPA also records 23 separate incidents on its Toxic Release Inventory. With high crime, mortality, and automobile accident rates, and considerable health risks, Bessemer would be considerably more dangerous if not for its relatively high degree of access to health care.</p>

							<p class="main-text">RewardExpert analyzed the 2016 FBI Crime in the United States statistics for every location for which data was included in Table 6: Crimes Known to Law Enforcement. We calculated a weighted average of violent and nonviolent crimes (80-20), modified to give additional weight to rates of more serious crime, i.e. homicide, rape, and arson. We then excluded places with fewer than 3,000 inhabitants for reasons of statistical significance (the locations with both the highest and lowest incidence of violent and non-violent crime were places with populations < 10 people).</p>
							<p class="main-text">We used GIS (Geographical Information Systems) data provided by the US Census bureau and analyzed data sets provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (Superfund/Brownfields sites, Toxic Release Inventory, and public institution structure points (hospitals and emergency/law enforcement facilities)), FEMA (Flood Loss & Emergency Response), NOAA (Tornado injuries/fatalities & economic damage), the USDOT (Fatal Crash Reporting System), annual daily traffic counts from Kalibrate, and foreclosure and mortgage delinquency rates as of May 2017 from CoreLogic. We also included various indicators from the CDC County Health Ratings and Roadmap data from March of 2017, including premature mortality rates by type, and other public health related indicators. Finally, we tallied the number of fatal workplace accidents recorded by OSHA, the number of ATF licensed firearms dealers by location or zip code.</p>
							<p class="main-text">We then calculated weighted percentile rankings for each set of indicators, which were then combined with the weighted average of violent and non-violent crime rates from the FBI CUIS statistics, to produce a final composite risk score. </p>
